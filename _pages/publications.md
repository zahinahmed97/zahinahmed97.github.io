This paper presents a comparative analysis of six popular programming languages (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and R) based on three key criteria: **readability**, **writability**, and **reliability**. The study examines these languages' theoretical characteristics and the preferences of programmers through a conducted survey. The findings indicate that **Python** excels in readability and writability, while **Java** stands out in reliability.

Most of the work, including designing the evaluation metrics, conducting the survey, and analyzing the results, was carried out by me. The study aims to provide insights that could influence the choice of programming languages for both new and experienced developers, with a focus on simplifying the learning curve and improving long-term maintenance of codebases.
