Welcome to my personal website! I am **Zahin Ahmed**, currently a **first-year PhD student** at *The George Washington University*,  enrolled in the **Computer Architecture** and **High Performance Computing** research focus in **Computer Engineering** under the supervision of Prof. Gina Adam. I have started my journey at GWU in **Fall 2024**.

With a background in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), I graduated *summa cum laude* from *North South University* with a **CGPA of 3.98/4.00**, which was the **highest CGPA** in the *School of Engineering and Physical Sciences*. My research interests are focused on exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, neuromorphic systems, and machine learning.

After graduating at the end of 2020 *(right in the middle of the pandemic)* I decided to take a break from studying for a while *(online classes were not my cup of tea)*. Hence, I joined *BRAC University* as a **Lecturer**, as teaching has always been my passion. Over the last 3 years, I have had the pleasure of teaching many students, serving as a mentor and guide to them, and it has only instilled my love for the profession. Hence, as academicians are constantly in the pursuit of knowledge, I decided to try my luck with research and PhD!
